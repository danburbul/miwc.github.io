When you're thinking about a big idea, one of the most difficult things to work out is how to get started. It doesn't matter whether it's a coding problem, or writing a story, or planning a holiday; it's impossible to fathom the full extent of a project without understanding how it can be broken down into smaller, more manageable elements. And then once you've figured out how to break it down, you need to find a way to piece it together. 

This is why so many people who have taken coding courses that focus on theory and syntax still have no idea where to begin when it comes to making real things. On its own, a perfect understanding of loops and arrays and objects won't get you anywhere.

Let's take a web app that scores the popularity of Dogs vs Cats based on tweets.

* We can start by building one thing that monitors Twitter for new mentions of "love dogs" and "love cats". 
* Then we add a layer that puts these tweets into a database as they come in. 
* Next we want to build another thing that reads those results from the database and outputs a counter.
* Plus, of course, we need to build a site that shows the score. And make it pretty. 
* And finally, we want to deploy it so that we can settle dog vs cat debates all over the world.

Individually, each of those challenges is quite achievable - even for someone fairly new to coding. In fact, the Dogs vs Cats idea comes from a student who is only a few weeks into Make It With Code and is already able to work out at least three out of five of those elements.

There's no perfect boilerplate that will work for breaking down every idea, because the components will vary so much from project to project. That's why we want our intro to Ruby students to learn how the small things they make can be used as building blocks for something bigger, rather than memorising the steps.
