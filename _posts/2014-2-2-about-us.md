The thing is, learning to code is generally dull. Making things with code is awesome but learning syntax on its own is about as much fun as memorising French verb conjugations - and we think, an equally terrible way of getting started.

Huw and I (Ben) decided to start Make it With Code after we put a blog post up to say we wanted 5 people to test a new type of course based on 'hacking stuff together' rather than learning syntax and got over 50 people wanting to try it in the first few hours.

Huw's a software product manager who now works primarily with startups and has previously worked with companies such as Vodafone Group. I'm a developer with about eight years experience in a range of languages and the author of a book on deploying ruby applications.

I 'built' websites before understanding HTML, database driven applications before knowing SQL and games before knowing what a loop was. By built I mean hacked together from things other people had made; I learnt just the bits I needed in order to make the stuff I wanted. As I discovered how awesome it was to actually make things, I learnt more and more of the theory simply because it was useful for building better things, not because that's what you're "meant to do".

 My learning cycle was:

 * this doesn't work / do what I want it to do
 * why not? lots of googling / asking people
 * learn a little bit of new theory to solve the problem
 * repeat

A lot of the best developers I've worked with learnt to code in this way, by hacking stuff together and picking up the theory as they went along. It also seems like quite an effective teaching method, you get the repeated little jolts of satisfaction from working out small problems and the ongoing feeling that you're actually making a thing.

But for this to work as a teaching method, there's a key ingredient which is often missing. It's an essential part of the learning process to spend time Googling and researching the problems you run into and fixing them yourself - this is what most developers spend a majority of their time doing. But, particularly when you're getting started, sometimes it feels there are problems you can't quite work out on your own. Anecdotally, this seems to be where a lot of people give up.

This is where Make it With Code comes in. As well as providing exercises structured to teach this process, we provide IM based support from a real developer (at the moment, me!) so that if you hit that wall, there's someone to ask for pointers. The introductory course consists of 10 lessons, each designed around building a small program which actually does something useful. These include:

- A tool to generate spreadsheets from twitter
- A web app to do list
- A website scraper

The lessons are based around what we think is an accurate representation of the real life workflow developers go through when making things, for example:

- Finding example code in readme's or StackOverflow and modifying it
- Fixing some broken code from us or another third party
- Breaking big problems down into small ones which can be solved with free code other people have already written
- Taking code from other similar projects and hacking it to do what we want

At the end of each lesson, you'll have made something, it will actually do something useful.

We provide a complete cloud based development environment so you don't have to worry about setting up your own. You just need access to a modern web browser (Chrome, Safari or Firefox). At the end we can provide assistance getting setup with a local environment if needed.

The cost is $99 (£60) per person and if, at any point during or after the course, you feel you're not getting value for money, we'll refund it without question. This is a new concept and the level of interest we've received since the blog post which started it all has been huge so, to make sure everyone gets a great level of support, we're starting people in staggered groups.
